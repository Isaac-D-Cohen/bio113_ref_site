            <h1 class="critical_titles">Important announcement</h1>
            <p>As you probably know, on April 8th about 3:15 PM, there will be a total eclipse of the sun, visible just 1-2 hours north of Binghamton. Below is a map of the totality. Please take this opportunity to go and see it. No matter what your professors say, ditch your classes! There is nothing happening in class that day that you'll remember in 20 years. But you will remember this eclipse!! </p>

            <p>
            <strong>GO SEE IT!</strong>

            <br> <br>

            <strike>â†’ Also, if you have a moment, please sign my <a href="https://chng.it/wzWgyB5LXv">petition</a> urging professors to excuse absences (and not schedule exams) that day.</strike>

            <br><br>
            Update: I found out another student is leading a petition that has amassed far more signatures than mine. Better to sign <a href="https://chng.it/R9SDSTW7wz">his petition</a>.

            <h3 class="titles">What is this?</h3>
            <p>In BIO 113 at our school, the discussion section requires submission of various written assignments over the course of the semester. Among other things, these assignments
            require students to format citations using a very specific referencing system made up exclusively for the BIO 113 course. The reason for this is obvious. If their goal were
            simply to teach material it would suffice to use APA, MLA, Chicago, or any of the other myriad, arbitrary forms of torture invented to drive students nuts over the years.
            But like all things in college, the purpose here is precisely to make things difficult so that students who rise to the challenge can signal their capabilities and leave
            their friends in the dust. I have written about this <a href="https://www.bupipedream.com/opinions/guest-column/the-case-against-universities/140926/">at length elsewhere</a> and
            won't belabor the point here. Suffice it to say, the problem from their perspective, with these other referencing systems is that software
            <a href="https://www.citationmachine.net/">is widely available</a> to automate them. Thus, they make up their own referencing system in the hopes of forcing students to go through the painful work of
            following it by hand. Because I despise these people and their rotten goal, and in the hopes of assisting the public in defending themselves against it, I have written this little website
            to at least partially automate the task of formatting according to their newly made-up referencing system. I hope you enjoy using it.<br><br>--Isaac Cohen</p>
